# Endless-Desert-Unity
A remake of my 2014 Java game Endless Desert with Unity, utilising lower-level features such as surface shaders and procedural generation to create a natural-looking desert world that extends forever on the X and Z axes.

This project serves to demonstrate my current level of familiarity with the Unity engine, its capabilities and its limits, as well as my capacity to solve problems through mathematical abstraction. In his particular project, I have found the surface normals of the sand through partial differential equations and created an O(log(n)) raycasting function for the same arbitrarily curved continuous surfaces created by the sand.

The full game is not yet finished, but the currently included build of the game works as an adequate demonstration of basic gameplay.
